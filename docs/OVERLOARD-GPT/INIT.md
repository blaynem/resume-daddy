**Stage 1: Market Research & Validation**

Goal 1: Validate the need for such an application. Conduct interviews, surveys, or use data from secondary sources to understand your target market's pain points.

Goal 2: Identify your competition and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Look for gaps in their services that your application can fill.

Goal 3: Analyze your target customers' willingness to pay for such a service. Explore different pricing models to decide what would work best for your business.

**Stage 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

Goal 4: Start by building a minimalistic version of your application. This will help you gather initial feedback and validate your business idea. Choose the most critical features for your MVP. Based on the features you have listed, a good start might be:

- Parse Resume
- Resume Builder
- Easy creation of cover letters
- Keeps track of what you've applied to

Goal 5: Launch your MVP and gather feedback. Use this feedback to iterate and improve the product.

**Stage 3: Additional Feature Development**

Goal 6: Based on feedback and usage data from your MVP, start developing and integrating additional features one at a time. The order will depend on feedback, but might look something like:

- Auto-complete entire job application on any website
- Creating custom resumes for each individual job application
- Resume embellisher
- Auto creates sign in for job application websites and keeps track of those
- Track roles across websites and check the posted salary ranges for those roles

**Stage 4: Crowdsourcing and Additional Services**

Goal 7: Once you have a solid user base and the main features are working smoothly, start integrating the crowdsourcing elements:

- Crowdsourcing the salary ranges for roles
- Crowdsourcing the interview questions for roles

Goal 8: Finally, add the additional service suggestions like levels.fyi does.

**Stage 5: Scaling**

Goal 9: Begin aggressive marketing and outreach. This should include PR, social media marketing, partnerships with universities, job search websites, and other relevant platforms.

Goal 10: Optimize your operations and customer service as you scale up. Make sure your application can handle the increased user load, and your customer service is scaled up to keep your users happy.

Remember, customer feedback should drive your development process at every stage. Test each feature extensively before launching it to ensure it's providing value to your users. Be prepared to pivot or adjust your plans based on the feedback you receive and the data you collect. Best of luck with your venture!
